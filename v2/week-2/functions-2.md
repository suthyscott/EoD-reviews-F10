Objectives
- Student can pass a function as an argument into another function.
- Student can invoke a parameter whose value is a function.
- Student can write a higher order function.
- Student can create/define functions using arrow function syntax.
- Student can use the following array methods: forEach, map, filter, and reduce.

What are the three ways to write a function? 
- declaration
- expression
- arrow functions

What's a benefit of arrow functions?
- single line/efficiency/readability (implicit)

What is a higher order function?

What would be a use case for: 
- filter (filtering out methods)
- forEach (loop over an array)
- map (loop over an array and return a new/altered copy)
- reduce (to loop over an array )
