Obviously your questions are our first priority. So never hesitate to interupt with a question about they day's content. 

Review the day's lecture handout to cover the broad level concepts of the day's topic. Bring up any questions on the afternoon project as the area comes up in the review. 

Going to be calling on students randomly to answer questions. 

Would like to ask every day

What was the hardest part of today's content to understand? 
What was easiest? 
What was your favorite part of the day's lab?
What was the coolest thing you learned from today's content?
