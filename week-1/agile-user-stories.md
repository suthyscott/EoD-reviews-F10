Explain Waterfall methodology. 

Explain Agile methodology. 

Pros and cons of Waterfall: 
Pros:
- Seems like a logical way to build software
- Easy to explain / understand
- Saves time/money if you commit to design & requirements early
- Allows for very strict deadlines (holds developers accountable)

Cons:
- Doesn’t allow for flexibility
- No input from users or customers until the very end
- A lot can get lost in translation
- Fails to recognize that as you build software, requirements can and need to be able to change
- “Overly regulated, planned, and micro-managed”


Agile: 
Pros:
- Allows for flexibility, end up with a better product (usually)
- More feedback from the user or customer
- Harder for developers to waste time building the wrong thing

Cons:
- Ambiguity and uncertainty of deadlines is difficult for the business side
- Project Managers have to constantly be changing and re-prioritizing
- Requires some training and understanding of Agile before you dive in



What are user stories?


Who writes user stories? 
- Generally a story is written by the product owner, product manager, or program manager and submitted for review.

So the program manager, executive, marketing expert or whoever is the point of contact from the customer (which can be internal or external) will be the one who builds out these user stories. They should have a solid understanding of desired end result. 

From there the team will choose user stories to tackle that sprint (in the sprint planning meeting). Using the user story they will identify the required functionality and requirements to make it a reality. Then those requirements will be added to the story. The story can then be pointed. 


It's somewhat difficult to quantify exactly what a user story is, as they can be somewhat abstract and differ from company to company. 

User stories help the drive the agile process, as you can have a clear, achievable goal for each sprint iteration, as defined by the goal expressed in the user story. 

User personas can drive a user story, as can any other real or hypothetical user/customer.
