What is runtime complexity? 
 - Runtime complexity is way to describes the performance of an algorithm
 - How long does it take my program to run compared to how much workload I have, where workload is the length of a list.

What are some common runtimes? 
- O(1)
- O(log n)
- O(n)
- O(n log n)
- O(n2)


Why do we care about the worst case scenario rather than the best case?
 - doesnâ€™t happen often (worst case is more likely)
 - most algorithms share best case 
 - eg, searching best case is always O(1)


What are some common data structures other than the built in arrays and objects? 
- Linked lists
- Queues
- Stacks
- Trees
